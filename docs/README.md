## 🎨 Design Track

✅ Splash screen  
✅ Welcome screen  
⚙️ Onboarding (Truck setup, Fuel networks)  
🚛 Route Planner / IFTA Summary  

**Design assets stored in:** `/design/`  
Includes Figma tokens, color system, and custom icons (Fuel, Rest, Facility, Weigh, SOS).

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

1. **Create Figma file** and import design tokens.  
2. Add `/design/msr-tokens.json` (ready JSON provided).  
3. Generate first 5 screens via **Galileo / Figma AI**.  
4. Create folder structure for `/frontend` and `/backend`.  
5. Commit assets and link Figma design in `docs/architecture.md`.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (planned)

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| Frontend | React Native / Expo + Tailwind (NativeWind) |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) or Node.js (Express) |
| Design | Figma + Tokens Studio + Galileo AI |
| Database | Firebase / Supabase (for MVP) |
| APIs | Fuel, Weather, IFTA (to be integrated) |
---

## 📅 Roadmap

| Phase | Goal | ETA |
|-------|------|-----|
| Phase 1 | Figma Prototype (MVP UX/UI) | 2 weeks |
| Phase 2 | Frontend / Route Planner demo | 3–4 weeks |
| Phase 3 | API integration (Fuel & Toll) | 6–8 weeks |
| Phase 4 | AI-driven optimization | Q2 2026 |

## 🧩 Vision

MSR (My Smart Road) is built for independent drivers and small fleets.  
Our mission is to make road operations intelligent, fuel-efficient, and stress-free.  
We believe AI should simplify—not complicate—the trucking life.
